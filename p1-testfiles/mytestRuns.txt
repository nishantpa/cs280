Ozymandias

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

I  met a traveller from an antique land Who said: "Two  vast
and  trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert . . .  Near
them, on the sand, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whos-

e   frown,
And wrink-
led   lip,
and  sneer

of  cold command, Tell that its sculptor
well those passions read Which yet surv-
ive,   stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed: And on the pedestal these words appear: 'My name is Ozymandias, ki-
ng of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wrec-
k, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away."-

Mutability

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; How
restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver, Str-
eaking the darkness radiantly!--yet soon Night cl-
oses round, and they are lost forever:

Or   like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
Give various response to each varying blast, To w-

hose frai-
l frame n-
o   second
motion br-

ings One mood or modulation like the la-
st.  We rest.--A dream has power to poi-
son sleep; We rise.--One wandering thou-
ght  pollutes the day; We feel, conceive
or   reason, laugh or weep; Embrace fond
