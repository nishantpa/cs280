Ozymandias

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

I  met   a   traveller   from  an  antique  land  Who  said:
"Two   vast   and  trunkless   legs  of   stone   Stand   in
the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk,
a shatter-
ed  visage
lies, who-
se  frown,
And wrink-
led   lip,
and  sneer
of cold c-
ommand, T-
ell   that
its sculp-
tor   well
those pas-
sions read
Which  yet
 survive,
stamped on
these lif-
eless thi-
ngs,

The   hand   that   mocked   them,   and
the  heart   that  fed:   And   on   the
pedestal   these   words   appear:   'My
name  is   Ozymandias,  king  of  kings:

Look   on   my   works,  ye  Mighty,   and   despair!'   Nothing   beside   remains.   Round   the   decay   Of   that
colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away."
