Ozymandias

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

I  met a traveller from an antique land Who said: "Two  vast
and  trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert . . .  Near
them, on the sand, Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whos-

e   frown,
And wrink-
led   lip,
and  sneer

of  cold command, Tell that its sculptor
well those passions read Which yet surv-
ive,   stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed: And on the pedestal these words appear: 'My name is Ozymandias, ki-
ng of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wrec-
k, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away."-
