Mutability

Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1792 - 1822

We   are  as   clouds   that  veil  the   midnight
moon;   How  restlessly  they  speed,  and  gleam,
and quiver, Streaking the darkness radiantly!--yet
soon  Night  closes   round,  and  they  are  lost
forever:

Or   like   forgotten   lyres,   whose   dissonant
strings Give  various  response  to  each  varying
blast, To  whose  frail  frame  no  second  motion
brings   One   mood   or   modulation   like   the
last.

We rest.--
-A   dream
has  power
to  poison
sleep;  We
rise.--One
  wandering
thought p-
ollutes t-
he day; We
feel, con-
ceive   or
reason, l-
augh or w-
eep; Embr-
ace   fond
woe, or c-
ast our c-
ares away:

It  is  the  same!--For,   be   it   joy
or  sorrow,  The path  of its  departure
still   is  free:  Man's  yesterday  may
ne'er   be   like  his  morrow;   Nought
may endure but Mutability.
