You say you stand by your man Tell me something I don't understand-

You said you love me and that-
's a fact And then you left m-
e, said you felt trapped  Wel-
l  some things you can explain
away But the heartache's in m-
e till this day  Did you stan-
d by me No, not at all-

Did you stand by me No way-


All the times When we were cl-
ose I'll remember these thing-
s the most I see all my dream-
s  come tumbling down I  can't
be happy without you around

So all alone I keep the wolve-
s at bay And there is only on-
e thing that I can say  Did y-
ou stand by me No, not at all-

Did you stand by me No way-


You must explain why this mus-
t be Did you lie when you spo-
ke to me  Did you stand by me-

No, not at all

Now  I got a job But it  don't
pay I need new clothes-

I  need somewhere to stay  But
without all these things I ca-
n   do But without your love I
won't make it through  But yo-
u don't understand my point o-
f view I suppose there's noth-
ing I can do  Did you stand b-
y me No, not at all-

Did you stand by me No way-


Did you stand by me No, not a-
t all Did you stand by me-

No way

You must explain why this mus-
t be Did you lie when you spo-

ke to me? Did you s-
tand   by me Did you
stand  by me No, not
at all Did you stan-
d  by me No way  Did
you stand by me No,
not  at all Did  you
stand by me No way-
